CHANGES

0.2
=====
General
-------
* file mode in Tree, Blob and Diff objects now is an int compatible to definintiions 
  in the stat module, allowing you to query whether individual user, group and other 
  read, write and execute bits are set.
* Adjusted class hierarchy to generally allow comparison and hash for Objects and Refs
* Improved Tag object which now is a Ref that may contain a tag object with additional 
  Information
* id_abbrev method has been removed as it could not assure the returned short SHA's 
  where unique
* removed basename method from Objects with path's as it replicated features of os.path
* from_string and list_from_string methods are now private and were renamed to 
  _from_string  and _list_from_string respectively. As part of the private API, they 
  may change without prior notice.
* Renamed all find_all methods to list_items - this method is part of the Iterable interface
  that also provides a more efficients and more responsive iter_items method

Item Iteration
--------------
* Previously one would return and process multiple items as list only which can 
  hurt performance and memory consumption and reduce response times. 
  iter_items method provide an iterator that will return items on demand as parsed 
  from a stream. This way any amount of objects can be handled.
  
objects Package
----------------
* blob, tree, tag and commit module have been moved to new objects package. This should 
  not affect you though unless you explicitly imported individual objects. If you just 
  used the git package, names did not change.
  
Repo
----
* Moved blame method from Blob to repo as it appeared to belong there much more.
* active_branch method now returns a Head object instead of a string with the name 
  of the active branch.
* tree method now requires a Ref instance as input and defaults to the active_branche
  instead of master
* Removed 'log' method as it as effectively the same as the 'commits' method

Diff
----
* Members a a_commit and b_commit renamed to a_blob and b_blob - they are populated
  with Blob objects if possible
* Members a_path and b_path removed as this information is kept in the blobs

Blob
----
* former 'name' member renamed to path as it suits the actual data better

Tree
----
* former 'name' member renamed to path as it suits the actual data better
* added traverse method allowing to recursively traverse tree items
* deleted blob method
* added blobs and trees properties allowing to query the respective items in the 
  tree
* now mimics behaviour of a read-only list instead of a dict to maintain order.
* content_from_string method is now private and not part of the public API anymore

Refs
----
* Will dynmically retrieve their object at the time of query to assure the information 
  is actual. Recently objects would be cached, hence ref object not be safely kept 
  persistent.

0.1.6
=====

General
-------
* Added in Sphinx documentation.

* Removed ambiguity between paths and treeishs. When calling commands that
  accept treeish and path arguments and there is a path with the same name as
  a treeish git cowardly refuses to pick one and asks for the command to use
  the unambiguous syntax where '--' seperates the treeish from the paths.

* ``Repo.commits``, ``Repo.commits_between``, ``Reop.commits_since``,
  ``Repo.commit_count``, ``Repo.commit``, ``Commit.count`` and
  ``Commit.find_all`` all now optionally take a path argument which
  constrains the lookup by path.  This changes the order of the positional
  arguments in ``Repo.commits`` and ``Repo.commits_since``.

Commit
------
* ``Commit.message`` now contains the full commit message (rather than just
  the first line) and a new property ``Commit.summary`` contains the first
  line of the commit message.

* Fixed a failure when trying to lookup the stats of a parentless commit from
  a bare repo.

Diff
----
* The diff parser is now far faster and also addresses a bug where
  sometimes b_mode was not set.

* Added support for parsing rename info to the diff parser. Addition of new
  properties ``Diff.renamed``, ``Diff.rename_from``, and ``Diff.rename_to``.

Head
----
* Corrected problem where branches was only returning the last path component
  instead of the entire path component following refs/heads/.

Repo
----
* Modified the gzip archive creation to use the python gzip module.

* Corrected ``commits_between`` always returning None instead of the reversed
  list.


0.1.5
=====

General
-------
* upgraded to Mock 0.4 dependency.

* Replace GitPython with git in repr() outputs.

* Fixed packaging issue caused by ez_setup.py.

Blob
----
* No longer strip newlines from Blob data.

Commit
------
* Corrected problem with git-rev-list --bisect-all. See
  http://groups.google.com/group/git-python/browse_thread/thread/aed1d5c4b31d5027

Repo
----
* Corrected problems with creating bare repositories.

* Repo.tree no longer accepts a path argument. Use:

    >>> dict(k, o for k, o in tree.items() if k in paths)

* Made daemon export a property of Repo. Now you can do this:

    >>> exported = repo.daemon_export
    >>> repo.daemon_export = True

* Allows modifying the project description. Do this:

    >>> repo.description = "Foo Bar"
    >>> repo.description
    'Foo Bar'

* Added a read-only property Repo.is_dirty which reflects the status of the
  working directory.

* Added a read-only Repo.active_branch property which returns the name of the
  currently active branch.


Tree
----
* Switched to using a dictionary for Tree contents since you will usually want
  to access them by name and order is unimportant.

* Implemented a dictionary protocol for Tree objects. The following:

    child = tree.contents['grit']

  becomes:

    child = tree['grit']

* Made Tree.content_from_string a static method.

0.1.4.1
=======

* removed ``method_missing`` stuff and replaced with a ``__getattr__``
  override in ``Git``.

0.1.4
=====

* renamed ``git_python`` to ``git``. Be sure to delete all pyc files before
  testing.

Commit
------
* Fixed problem with commit stats not working under all conditions.

Git
---
* Renamed module to cmd.

* Removed shell escaping completely.

* Added support for ``stderr``, ``stdin``, and ``with_status``.

* ``git_dir`` is now optional in the constructor for ``git.Git``.  Git now 
  falls back to ``os.getcwd()`` when git_dir is not specified.

* add a ``with_exceptions`` keyword argument to git commands. 
  ``GitCommandError`` is raised when the exit status is non-zero.

* add support for a ``GIT_PYTHON_TRACE`` environment variable. 
  ``GIT_PYTHON_TRACE`` allows us to debug GitPython's usage of git through 
  the use of an environment variable.

Tree
----
* Fixed up problem where ``name`` doesn't exist on root of tree.

Repo
----
* Corrected problem with creating bare repo.  Added ``Repo.create`` alias.

0.1.2
=====

Tree
----
* Corrected problem with ``Tree.__div__`` not working with zero length files.  
  Removed ``__len__`` override and replaced with size instead. Also made size 
  cach properly. This is a breaking change.
