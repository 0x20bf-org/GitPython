CHANGES
=======

0.1.5
=====

* removed ``method_missing`` stuff and replaced with a ``__getattr__`` 
  override in ``Git``.

0.1.4
=====

* renamed ``git_python`` to ``git``. Be sure to delete all pyc files before
  testing.

Commit
------
* Fixed problem with commit stats not working under all conditions.

Git
---
* Renamed module to cmd.

* Removed shell escaping completely.

* Added support for ``stderr``, ``stdin``, and ``with_status``.

* ``git_dir`` is now optional in the constructor for ``git.Git``.  Git now 
  falls back to ``os.getcwd()`` when git_dir is not specified.

* add a ``with_exceptions`` keyword argument to git commands. 
  ``GitCommandError`` is raised when the exit status is non-zero.

* add support for a ``GIT_PYTHON_TRACE`` environment variable. 
  ``GIT_PYTHON_TRACE`` allows us to debug GitPython's usage of git through 
  the use of an environment variable.

Tree
----
* Fixed up problem where ``name`` doesn't exist on root of tree.

Repo
----
* Corrected problem with creating bare repo.  Added ``Repo.create`` alias.

0.1.2
=====

Tree
----
* Corrected problem with ``Tree.__div__`` not working with zero length files.  
  Removed ``__len__`` override and replaced with size instead. Also made size 
  cach properly. This is a breaking change.
