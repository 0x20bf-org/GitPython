CHANGES

0.1.5
=====

General
-------
* upgraded to Mock 0.4 dependency.

* Replace GitPython with git in repr() outputs.

* Fixed packaging issue caused by ez_setup.py.

Blob
----
* No longer strip newlines from Blob data.

Commit
------
* Corrected problem with git-rev-list --bisect-all. See
  http://groups.google.com/group/git-python/browse_thread/thread/aed1d5c4b31d5027

Repo
----
* Corrected problems with creating bare repositories.

* Repo.tree no longer accepts a path argument. Use:

    >>> dict(k, o for k, o in tree.items() if k in paths)

* Made daemon export a property of Repo. Now you can do this:

    >>> exported = repo.daemon_export
    >>> repo.daemon_export = True

* Allows modifying the project description. Do this:

    >>> repo.description = "Foo Bar"
    >>> repo.description
    'Foo Bar'

* Added a read-only property Repo.is_dirty which reflects the status of the
  working directory.

* Added a read-only Repo.active_branch property which returns the name of the
  currently active branch.


Tree
----
* Switched to using a dictionary for Tree contents since you will usually want
  to access them by name and order is unimportant.

* Implemented a dictionary protocol for Tree objects. The following:

    child = tree.contents['grit']

  becomes:

    child = tree['grit']

* Made Tree.content_from_string a static method.

0.1.4.1
=======

* removed ``method_missing`` stuff and replaced with a ``__getattr__``
  override in ``Git``.

0.1.4
=====

* renamed ``git_python`` to ``git``. Be sure to delete all pyc files before
  testing.

Commit
------
* Fixed problem with commit stats not working under all conditions.

Git
---
* Renamed module to cmd.

* Removed shell escaping completely.

* Added support for ``stderr``, ``stdin``, and ``with_status``.

* ``git_dir`` is now optional in the constructor for ``git.Git``.  Git now 
  falls back to ``os.getcwd()`` when git_dir is not specified.

* add a ``with_exceptions`` keyword argument to git commands. 
  ``GitCommandError`` is raised when the exit status is non-zero.

* add support for a ``GIT_PYTHON_TRACE`` environment variable. 
  ``GIT_PYTHON_TRACE`` allows us to debug GitPython's usage of git through 
  the use of an environment variable.

Tree
----
* Fixed up problem where ``name`` doesn't exist on root of tree.

Repo
----
* Corrected problem with creating bare repo.  Added ``Repo.create`` alias.

0.1.2
=====

Tree
----
* Corrected problem with ``Tree.__div__`` not working with zero length files.  
  Removed ``__len__`` override and replaced with size instead. Also made size 
  cach properly. This is a breaking change.
